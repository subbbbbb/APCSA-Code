Write two methods for the Picture Class.
1)Write a method that mirrors pixel color data from top of image to the bottom.
Mirroring will destroy data so original data from bottom half of image will be lost.
2)Write a method that reverse color data from left to write for all rows. Reversing does not lose data but changes the order.
