# basic math operators
print(1+2)
print(4-2)
print(5*3)
print(42/3)
print(14 % 3)
print(2**3)  # for exponents
print(5//2)  # this divides the numbers, but does not return the remainder, just the greatest whole number

# comparison operators
# == is equals
# != is not equals
# greater than and less than, same as java

# logical operators
x = 420
print(x > 300 and x < 400)  # if both test cases are true, then it returns true
print(x > 300 or x < 400)  # if one of the test cases is true, then it returns true

# identity operators
y = 32
print(x is y)  # if both test cases are the same, it returns true
print(x is not y)  # if both test cases are NOT the same, it returns true

# membership operators
str1 = "precious"
str2 = "ecio"
if str2 in str1:  # 'in' is just .contains() in java
    print("hi")
# opposite can be said for 'not in'
